# Adding Windows Systems to Netwatch

This guide describes how to add Windows systems to Netwatch using pre-configured PowerShell-based executables.

There are two deployment options

- **Per-Host Executable** – For installing on individual systems.
- **Domain Controller (DC) Executable** – For centralized agent deployment across multiple systems.

## Per-Host Executable

This method is used to install Netwatch on a single system.

### Steps

1. Get the executable from the link (To be shared).

         ### netwatch_installer_xxxx_host.exe

2. Run the file as **Administrator** on the target host
- Right-click → **Run as administrator**


<ZoomableImage src="/images/admin.png" alt="Per-Host Executable" />


- A command window will appear showing the progress

3. Once complete, the system will appear in Netwatch under its respective host group.

## Domain Controller Executable

Used for bulk deployment across a domain.

### Steps

1. Get the correct executable from the link.

      ### netwatch_installer_xxxx_DC.exe



2. Run the file as **Administrator** on the Domain Controller:
- This will silently install the agent on all domain-joined systems.

3. The added systems will automatically appear in Netwatch.

## Key Notes

- These installers are safe to run and **do not trigger reboots**.
- They use PowerShell internally but are wrapped for ease of use.
- **No system configuration is altered**, apart from installing the Netwatch agent.
- Executables are customer-specific – ensure you are using the correct one for the environment.
