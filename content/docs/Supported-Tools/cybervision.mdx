title: Configuring Cisco Cyber Vision Monitoring in Netwatch
---

import ZoomableImage from '@/components/ZoomableImage';

## Overview
Netwatch integrates with **Cisco Cyber Vision** using its **REST API v3** and **Bearer token authentication**. Unlike other HTTP-based integrations, Cyber Vision does **not** use basic authentication. Instead, Netwatch queries the Cyber Vision Center using a **static API token** passed in the HTTP Authorization header.

This integration enables monitoring of OT asset inventory, security alerts, vulnerabilities, and system health from a centralized Netwatch dashboard.

## What Netwatch Monitors in Cyber Vision
Netwatch can collect and monitor the following Cyber Vision data:

- **Asset Inventory**
  - Discovered OT/ICS assets
  - Asset type, vendor, and firmware details
- **Security Alerts**
  - Active alerts and incidents
  - Severity levels (critical, high, medium, low)
- **Vulnerabilities**
  - Assets impacted by known vulnerabilities
  - Risk exposure indicators
- **System Health**
  - Cyber Vision Center availability
  - API responsiveness
- **Discovery**
  - Automatic discovery of assets and alert entities

## Prerequisites
Before configuring Cyber Vision monitoring in Netwatch, ensure:

- Cisco Cyber Vision Center is deployed and reachable
- Cyber Vision REST API v3 is enabled
- A valid **API Bearer token** has been generated
- Network connectivity exists between Netwatch and Cyber Vision Center
- HTTPS (TCP 443) access is permitted

## 1. Generate Cisco Cyber Vision API Token
Cisco Cyber Vision uses token-based authentication.

1. Log in to **Cisco Cyber Vision Center**.
2. Navigate to **Administration** → **API tokens**.
3. Generate a new API token with read permissions.
4. Copy and securely store the token.  
   This token will be used by Netwatch as a **Bearer token**.

## 2. Add Cyber Vision Host in Netwatch
1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Hosts**.
2. Click **Create Host**.
3. Configure the host:
   - **Host name**: CyberVision-OT
   - **Host group**: Security / OT Monitoring
   - **Agent interface**: Cyber Vision Center IP or hostname

## 3. Configure Host Macros (Critical Step)
Cyber Vision authentication is handled entirely via macros.

Go to the **Macros** tab and add the following **host macros**:

| Macro | Value | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `{$CISCO.CV.BASEURL}` | `https://<cybervision-ip>/` | Cyber Vision base URL |
| `{$CISCO.CV.BEARER}` | `<API_TOKEN>` | Bearer token (Secret text) |

**Important notes:**
- The **BASEURL must not include `/api/v3`**
- `/api/v3` is appended internally by the Netwatch template
- The Bearer token must be stored as **Secret text**

Example:
- `{$CISCO.CV.BASEURL}` → `https://172.XXX.XXX.XXX/`
- `{$CISCO.CV.BEARER}` → `ics-e13a9af5...`

## 4. API Endpoint Usage (Reference)
Netwatch communicates with Cyber Vision using endpoints such as:


No username/password authentication is used.

## 5. Verify Data Collection
Within a few minutes:

1. Navigate to **Monitoring** → **Latest Data**
2. Select the Cyber Vision host
3. Confirm availability of:
   - Asset counts
   - Active alerts by severity
   - Vulnerability metrics
   - API health checks

## 6. Cyber Vision Dashboards
Netwatch dashboards provide OT security visibility.

Dashboards include:
- Asset inventory overview
- Active security alerts
- Vulnerability exposure summary
- OT network security posture

## Key Considerations
- Cyber Vision uses **Bearer token authentication only**
- Do **not** include `/api/v3` in the base URL macro
- Store API tokens securely using **Secret Text macros**
- Ensure certificates are trusted if using HTTPS
